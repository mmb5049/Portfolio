            <p>
                Hi, I'm Minh! I'm a passionate game designer and developer dedicated to crafting immersive and memorable experiences. 
                With expertise in C#, Unity, and Maya, I specialize in bringing creative ideas to life through innovative mechanics, 
                engaging gameplay, and stunning visuals. Whether it's designing intricate game worlds, implementing complex systems, 
                or fine-tuning player interactions, I thrive at every stage of the development process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Beyond game development, I have a strong foundation in web design. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy creating 
                dynamic and visually appealing websites that complement my creative vision. My experience in web development allows me 
                to bridge the gap between interactive media and functional design.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me exploring new games, staying inspired by industry trends, and 
                continuously honing my skills to push creative boundaries. My goal is to leave a lasting impact on players and users 
                by blending technical expertise with creative storytelling.

                    varying slopes.

                    and wandering to interact dynamically. A centralized spawn manager assigns randomized attributes, while NPCs respond to 
                    neighbors and global goals. Visual tools and efficient detection ensure scalability for simulations or games.
